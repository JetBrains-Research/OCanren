\section{Conclusion}

We presented an approach for the conversion of typed functional programs into relations. 
Relational conversion in many cases allows to avoid tedious recoding of functional specifications
into relational form and to concentrate on writing relational specifications only when their
reconstruction from functions is impossible or undesirable. Our implementation works for the
subset of Objective Caml; we evaluated it for a number of interesting examples.
