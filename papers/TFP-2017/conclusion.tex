\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

We presented an approach for conversion of typed functional programs into relations. Relational conversion 
in many cases allows us to avoid tedious recoding of functional specifications into relational form and to 
concentrate on writing relational specifications only when their reconstruction from functions is impossible or 
undesirable. Our implementation works for the subset of OCaml; we evaluated it for a number of interesting 
examples and acquired some new relational solutions.
