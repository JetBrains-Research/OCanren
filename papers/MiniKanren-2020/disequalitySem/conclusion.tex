\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we presented an extended version of formal semantics for miniKanren, supporring disequality constraints.
The semantics is parametrized by exact implementation of constraint stores and allows to ensure correctness of different implementations in a unified way, using the given set of sufficient conditions.

We plan to finish the Coq certification of the whole deveopment in the nearest future.
We also are going to look at other applications of the semantics for proving useful properties of different disequality implementations.
