\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we presented an extended version of formal semantics for \textsc{miniKanren} which supports disequality constraints.
The semantics is parametrized by exact implementation of constraint stores and allows to ensure the correctness of different implementations
in a unified way, using given set of sufficient conditions.

We plan to finish the \textsc{Coq} mechanization of the whole deveopment in the nearest future. We also are going to look at other applications
of the semantics for proving useful properties of different disequality implementations.
