\section{Optimization}
\label{sec:optimization}

In this section we address two aspects of our solution: a number of optimizations which make the search more efficient, and
the way it ends up with the optimal solution.

Relational goal in its final form, presented in the previous section, does not demonstrate a good performance. Thus, we apply a number
of techniques, some of which require extending the implementation of the search. Namely, we apply the following optimizations:

\begin{itemize}
\item We make use of type information to restrict the subset of constructors which may appear in a certain branch of
  program being synthesized.
\item We implement \emph{structural constraints} which allow to restrict the shape of terms during the search, and
  utilize them to implement pruning.  
\end{itemize}

In our formalization we do not make any use of types since as a rule type information does not affect matching. In addition,
utilizing the properties of a concrete type system would make our approach too coupled with this particular type system, hampering
its reusability for other languages. Nevertheless we may use a certain abstraction of type system which would deliver only
that part of information which is essential for our approach to function. Currently, we calculate a type of any matching expression in
program being generated and from this type extract the subset of constuctors which can appear when branching on this expression
is performed.
