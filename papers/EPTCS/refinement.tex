\section{Refinement and Top-Level Primitives}
\label{refinement}

We did not make \lstinline{refine} accessible for an end-user; instead we provided
a set of top-level combinators, which should be used to surround relational code
and perform refinement in a transparent manner. Note, from pragmatic
standpoint only variables, supplied as arguments for the top-level goal, have
to be refined (the original miniKanren implementation follows the same convention).

The toplevel primitive in our implementation is \lstinline{run}, which takes three
arguments. The exact type of \lstinline{run} is rather complex and non-instructive, 
so we better describe the typical form of its application:

\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true]
   run $\overline{n}$ (fun $l_1\dots l_n$ -> $\;\;G$) (fun $a_1\dots a_n$ -> $\;\;H$)
\end{lstlisting}

Here $\overline{n}$ stands for \emph{numeral}, which describes the number of
parameters for two other arguments of \lstinline{run}, \mbox{$l_1\dots l_n$}~---
free logical variables, $G$~--- a goal (which can make use of \mbox{$l_1\dots l_n$}), 
\mbox{$a_1\dots a_n$}~--- refined answers for \mbox{$l_1\dots l_n$}, respectively, and, 
finally, $H$~--- a \emph{handler} (which can make use of \mbox{$a_1\dots a_n$}). The types of 
\mbox{$l_1\dots l_n$} are inferred from $G$, and the types of \mbox{$a_1\dots a_n$} are
inferred from types of \mbox{$l_1\dots l_n$}: if $l_i$ has type \lstinline[mathescape=true]{$t$ logic}, then
$a_i$ has type \lstinline[mathescape=true]{$t$ logic stream}. In other words, user-defined handler
takes streams of refined answers for all variables, supplied to the top-level goal. All streams $a_i$ contains
coherent elements, so they all have the same length and $n$-th elements of all streams correspond 
to the $n$-th answer, produced by the goal $G$.

There are a few predefined numerals for one, two, etc. arguments (called, by tradition, 
\lstinline{q}, \lstinline{qr}, \lstinline{qrs} etc.), and a successor function, which 
can be applied to existing numeral to increment the number of expected arguments. The
technique, used to implement them, generally follows~\cite{Unparsing, DoWeNeed}.
