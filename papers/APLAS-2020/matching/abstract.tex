   We apply relational programming techniques to the problem of synthesizing efficient implementation for a pattern matching construct. Although in principle
   pattern matching can be implemented in a trivial way, the result suffers from inefficiency in terms of both performance and code size. Thus, in implementing functional languages alternative, more elaborate  approaches are widely used. However, as there are multiple kinds and flavors of pattern
   matching constructs, these approaches have to be specifically developed and justified for each concrete inhabitant of the pattern matching ``zoo.'' We formulate the
   pattern matching synthesis problem in relational terms and develop optimizations which improve the efficiency of the synthesis and guarantee the
   optimality of the result. Our approach is based on relational representations of both the high-level semantics of pattern matching and the semantics of
   an intermediate-level implementation language. This choice make our approach, in principle, more scalable as we only need to modify the high-level semantics in order
   to synthesize the implementation of a new feature. Our evaluation on a set of small samples, partially taken from existing literature shows, that our framework is
   capable of synthesizing optimal implementations quickly. Our in-depth stress evaluation on a number of artificial benchmarks, however,
   has shown the need for future improvements.
